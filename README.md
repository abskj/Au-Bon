Au Bon is restaurant management system. It has the functionality that can serve a single restaurant as well as a chain. Its primary task has been to efficiently allow for billing a cutomer(using only keyboard operations) but compared to most such software this runs in a browser and keeps saving data continuously to the server which can either be on cloud or running locally via XAMPP.This can easily print bill for thermal printers but you may need to configure the Bill.php file in app folder. Feel welcome to submit any issues.
